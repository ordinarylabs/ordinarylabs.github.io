      <h1>Outline</h1>
      <p>
        You and your group have been assigned the task of taking over and
        running a manufacturing facility for 3 years!
      </p>
      <p>
        Your overall goal is to get the factory to the point where it is
        producing enough units annually to warrant keeping the line running
        indefinitely; the long-term success of each member of your group depends
        (to varying degrees) on the factory staying open.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the group's overall goal, you are each provided with a
        personal incentive which may or may not conflict with the incentives of
        the others and of the whole. Each of you&mdash;in order to maximize your
        own likelihood of success&mdash;must hold the incentives of the
        <i>others</i> in tension with the incentives of the <i>individual</i> to
        increase the probability of a successful the outcome for the
        <i>whole</i>.

      <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this game is to teach people how to think about and navigate
        systems by intentionally set up competing incentives for the whole and
        the individuals who make up the whole, and outline that in the highest
        performance system, sometimes none of the components will be operating
        at maximum capacity. Revealing to folks that overall efficiency is more
        about how the parts fit together, creating slack, balancing competing
        incentives, and choosing the right moment to strike. Demonstrating also
        that individual success is also a lot more tightly correlated to the
        overall success of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Systems thinking is at the heart of this game, and while the terminology
        may not be employed and the concepts are obfuscated by
        oversimplifications and trivial mechanics, the goal is to get people
        thinking about trade-offs and balancing their own individual interest
        with the interest of others and the interest of the whole, as that is
        the only way for them to increase the likelihood of their own success.
      </p>

      <h2 id="long-term-goals">Long-Term Goals</h2>
      <p>
        From the beginning I've designed the game with the constraint that a
        physical version would be possible and convenient to manufacture. The
        long-term goal is to produce an IRL tabletop version of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also designing the game with future enhancement in mind and the
        possibility of adding expansions (see:
        <a href="#expansions">Expansions</a>) that would introduce other "real
        world" complicating factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artistically I would also really love to see what can be done with a
        physical representation of the game. While I have <i>some</i> artistic
        ability, I am actually a lot more interested in seeing how
        other&mdash;more talented&mdash;artists would present the game in its
        physical manifestation, so I would like to find a (few?) illustrator(s)
        who could bring even stronger clarity and life to the game.
      </p>

      <h2 id="game-concepts">Game Concepts</h2>
      <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
      <p>
        The 3 roles&mdash;which are randomly assigned to each player at the
        beginning of the game&mdash;are Manager, Engineer and Operator. For each
        game there will always be only 1 Manager, at least 1 Engineer and at
        least 2 Operators. The exact number of Engineers and Operators depends
        on the number of players, but there will always be at least 1 more
        Operators than there are Engineers (accommodates 4-10 players).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>4 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 1 Engineer, 2 Operators</li>
        <li><strong>5 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 1 Engineer, 3 Operators</li>
        <li><strong>6 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 2 Engineers, 3 Operators</li>
        <li><strong>7 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 2 Engineers, 4 Operators</li>
        <li><strong>8 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 2 Engineers, 5 Operators</li>
        <li><strong>9 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 3 Engineers, 5 Operators</li>
        <li>
          <strong>10 players:</strong> 1 Manager, 3 Engineers, 6 Operators
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Manger is responsible for coordinating overall operations, approving
        requests from Engineers, setting income levels and has the final say on
        time/resource allocation. The Engineers are responsible for refining
        process, and the discovery, installation and repair of equipment. The
        Operators are responsible for execution of process, handling mishaps and
        advocating for improvements.
      </p>
      <h4 id="incentives">Incentives</h4>
      <p>
        Each player is given their own incentive tracker in addition to a wealth
        tracker. Each player's incentive tracker affects both the overall game
        play and their personal likelihood of success at the conclusion of the
        game, while their wealth tracker only impacts their personal likelihood
        of success at game's end.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manager's incentive:</strong> Annual Profits</li>
        <li><strong>Engineer's incentive:</strong> Level of Seniority</li>
        <li><strong>Operator's incentive:</strong> Avoiding Injury</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="manager">Manager</h4>
      <p>
        The Manager's goal is to operate each of the 3 years profitably. Each
        year a profit is not turned negatively impacts the Manager's individual
        probability of success.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manager is in charge of setting income, approvals for Engineering
        tasks, and approvals of Engineering promotions.
      </p>
      <h4 id="engineer">Engineer</h4>
      <p>
        The Engineers are motivated to increase their "level" or receive
        promotions. Each Engineer starts out as an Engineer I, and can be
        promoted to Engineer II and Senior Engineer by successfully executing
        certain tasks associated with their role. With each promotion the
        Engineers' abilities are enhanced, and their probability of success is
        improved at the end of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineers are eligible to receive promotions at the end of the year if
        specific equipment they installed that year remains on the board through
        the end of the year. When an engineer installs a piece of equipment,
        they place their ID card under the piece of equipment they installed to
        keep track of what work they did. At the end of the year when the
        engineer receives a promotion, they pull their ID card and cannot be
        promoted twice for the same equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        An engineer can only assign their ID card to one piece of equipment they
        install in a given year, if they install a second piece of equipment
        while their first is in play, they cannot move their ID card. If
        equipment with an engineer's ID card is replaced in a given year, the
        Engineer will not receive a promotion and cannot re-play their ID card.
        <strong><i>(This rule structure is subject to change and it's possible that
        engineers could also have a portion of their income determined by their
        level?)</strong></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        All engineering promotions are subject to manager approval and the
        manager can choose to deny a promotion.
      </p>
      <h4 id="operator">Operator</h4>
      <p>
        The Operators are given the incentive to avoid injury; if 3 injuries are
        sustained on the job, the Operator is forced to retire early and is
        effectively eliminated from play. But for each injury that is sustained
        leading up to elimination, it also increases the injured Operator's
        personal expenses and their productivity within the factory. Injuries
        are sustained when a mishap occurs and process is not sufficiently
        refined to prevent an injury.

      <p>
        First, place a black process refinement marker on the 3rd slot of the 5
        open slots. Place the black annual tracker arrow and red start of year
        arrow at the 2nd marker on the Cash Position section, and the black
        units sold arrow and red inventory arrows on the Units section. Finally,
        black markers on the 1st quarter position and the 1st month position.
      </p>
      <h4 id="cards">Cards</h4>
      <p>
        Pull out the 3 grey "starter" equipment cards from the equipment deck
        (24 total cards: 3 starter, and 7 red/blue/green); these will be placed
        in equipment slots 1, 2 and 3. Then shuffle the remaining equipment
        cards&mdash;the remaining cards are the equipment draw pile.
        Additionally, shuffle the mishap cards (48 total cards)&mdash;this will
        make up the mishap draw pile.
      </p>
      <h4 id="players">Players</h4>
      <p>
        Next, shuffle the role cards (refer to the
        <a href="#roles">Roles</a> section above for the role breakdown for each
        player count configuration) and randomly distribute to all of the
        players in the group. The Manager is given 3 black markers, 3 red
        markers (to be used for recording the profitability of each year) and
        the 3 Income tracking arrows. The Engineer(s) is(are) given a single
        black marker which is placed on the "Level I" position to start, and the
        Operators are given 3 red markers to use on their injury tracker which
        starts with all slots empty. All players are given their wealth tracking
        arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 9 ID cards in total and all but the manager must select an ID
        card for use in the game. The manager instead receives the double sided
        "Approve"/"Deny" card. In addition to their ID cards, operators are
        given a Union Membership card that is used to indicate their intent to
        strike.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Engineer(s) must also draw from the equipment deck; the number of
        cards each Engineer draws depends on the number of total Engineers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 Engineer</strong>: 3 cards</li>
        <li><strong>2 Engineers</strong>: 2 cards each</li>
        <li><strong>3 Engineers</strong>: 1 card each</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="annually">Annually</h3>
      <h4 id="annual-trackers-start">Trackers (Start)</h4>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each year both the quarter tracker and month tracker
        should be set to their first position, and the previous year Cash
        Position marker (red) should be shifted to the current Cash Position
        marker's (black) position.
      </p>
      <h4 id="set-income">Set Income</h4>
      <p>
        The Manager has the responsibility of setting the income for each of the
        roles (including their own).
      </p>
      <h4 id="annual-trackers-end">Trackers (End)</h4>
      <p>
        At the end of the year, the Manager has to set their profitability
        tracker for that year. If the current Cash Position tracker is at or
        below the previous year cash position marker, a red token is placed on
        the Manager's profitability tracker; if the current tracker is above the
        previous year marker, then a black token is placed.
      </p>
      <h3 id="quarterly">Quarterly</h3>
      <h4 id="equipment-discovery">Equipment Discovery</h4>
      <p>
        During the quarter, each Engineer is allowed to draw 1 equipment card
        for each level on their role card, in exchange for their time (limit one
        per month). They can only hold 3 cards in their hand at one time, and
        must pick to either discard the drawn card or one from their hand if
        drawing would result in holding more than 3 cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing equipment cards is the the only portion of an Engineer's time
        management that is not subject to approval, thus their in-game
        promotions are designed to model higher levels of autonomy.
      </p>
      <h4 id="mishap-events">Mishap Events</h4>
      <p>
        During the quarter, mishap cards must be drawn corresponding to the
        number of Operators in the game. Only one mishap card can be drawn in a
        single month, but for games where 1-2 mishap cards are drawn for each
        quarter, the Operators collectively decide which month(s) to draw them
        in, each quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the mishap breaks any equipment, the affected equipment must be
        flipped over to indicate repair is necessary at the beginning of the
        next month.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2-3 Operators:</strong> 1 mishap per quarter</li>
        <li><strong>4-5 Operators:</strong> 2 mishaps per quarter</li>
        <li><strong>6 Operators:</strong> 3 mishaps per quarter</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="quarter-trackers">Trackers</h4>
      <p>
        At the end of each quarter, the quarter time tracker is moved forward.
        If it is the 4th quarter, then the quarter tracker is moved back to
        first position and a new year begins.
      </p>
      <h3 id="monthly">Monthly</h3>
      <h4 id="cost-of-goods">Cost of Goods</h4>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each month, the Cost of Goods die is rolled; this
        value affects both the production cost of each Unit and determines the
        impact on individual wealth of each player. Each player takes their
        monthly income, subtracts the Cost of Goods amount to determine their
        "take home" after expenses, and increases or decreases their wealth by
        the result.
      </p>
      <h4 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h4>
      <p>
        Operators have the responsibility of checking the setting the
        "maintenance due" marker on each piece of equipment for which
        maintenance is due. If a piece of equipment is marked "monthly
        maintenance" then it will be set each month, if "quarterly" each quarter
        and if "annually" each year.
      </p>
      <h4 id="process-&-equipment">Process & Equipment</h4>
      <p>
        Next the Engineers are given the opportunity to negotiate for the
        installation of new equipment and/or process improvements for the
        factory. The Manager can "approve" or "deny" their request (Engineers
        have to include maintenance and repairs of existing equipment is into
        their allocations, unless that equipment is being replaced). If the
        request is denied, all Operator time is devoted to building within the
        existing system. If the request is approved, then the Operators and
        Engineers allocate time based on what is outlined on the equipment cards
        in play, or being installed&mdash;whatever of the Operators' time is
        left over is assigned to producing Units.

      <p>
        If during the resource allocation process, maintenance is left undone on
        any equipment that remains in operation, the black and white die is
        rolled to determine whether the equipment breaks; any roll 4-6 indicates
        the machine has broken, and will cost 2x to repair, as well as remove
        the machine's production multiplier and shift the process refinement
        tracker back one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The broken equipment gets flipped over until it is repaired, and should
        maintain its "maintenance due" marker to indicate that 2x cost for
        repair.

      <h4 id="operators-strike">Operators Strike</h4>
      <p>
        If for any reason the Operators are discontented with some aspect of the
        planning or direction of the plant (for which they are always entitled
        to and encouraged to offer their input), they are provided the ability
        to "strike" and refuse to participate in the building of units for a
        month at a time. In order for operators to strike, they have to get a
        majority vote from their peers (i.e if 2 players are operators, both
        players would need to agree to strike. If 3 players are operators, only
        2 need to agree to the strike). In months where they strike, operators
        forego their income for that month, and the Cost of Goods die still
        reduces their wealth, but no mishap will be drawn for that month, no
        process improvement can take place, and no units will be produced.
      </p>
      <h4 id="expenses-&-unit-production">Expenses & Unit Production</h4>
      <h5 id="capex">Capital Expenditure</h5>
      <p>
        To calculate the CapEx the group needs to add all investments in new
        equipment, and then move the Current Cash Position arrow down by the
        resulting amount.
      </p>
      <h5 id="units-produced">Units Produced</h5>
      <p>
        The number of units must be calculated based on the current process,
        equipment and time allocation for that month, and the Manager shifts the
        inventory tracker by the number of units produced that round.
      </p>
      <h5 id="opex">Operating Expense</h5>
      <p>
        To calculate the OpEx, the cost of goods multiplied by produced unit
        count (calculated in previous step), income paid to Manager, Engineer(s)
        and Operators, and inventory costs must be added together and also
        subtracted from the Current Cash Position.
      </p>
      <h4 id="demand-&-revenue">Demand & Revenue</h4>
      <p>
        Finally, it is the Manager's responsibility to roll the demand die to
        determine the amount each unit can be sold for relative to inventory and
        total units sold. When the number of units to be sold is determined, the
        Manager shifts the inventory marker down by that number, and the total
        units sold number up by that number, as well as the current cash
        position tracker up by the amount of revenue generated.
      </p>
      <h4 id="monthly-trackers">Trackers</h4>
      <p>
        At the end of each month, the tracker is moved forward. If it is the end
        of the 3rd month, the quarter tracker is moved forward and the monthly
        tracker is moved to the first position and a new quarter and month
        begins.
