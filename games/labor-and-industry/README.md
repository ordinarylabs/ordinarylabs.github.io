# Labor and Industry (Board Game)

open the html files.

disclaimer: posting this "as is" in a pre-draft, pre-functional state.

i don't intend to "own" or monetize any aspect of the game but would love to see anyone who is interested in the concept do whatever they want with it. (some of what's there still includes outdated references to wanting to make money with it -- those can be ignored).

`npm run build` to transpile the TS to JS.
