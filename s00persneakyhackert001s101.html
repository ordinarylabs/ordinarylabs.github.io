        <h3>purpose</h3>
        <p>
            exist as an interactive and [slightly] more accessible 
            mechanism for the differently enlightened to learn about the "what?" of end-to-end
            encryption &amp; digital signatures, with some context to provide a 
            high level overview for the "how?" they're leveraged, in practice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>signing keys</h2>
        <p>
            this set of keys is used for <i>verification</i>. 
            your "digital signature" or your "fingerprint" unique
            to you as the <i>sender</i> of messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            when you create a new message, you "sign" it with your
            <i>private</i> signing key/fingerprint, and the recipient of your
            message, uses your <i>public</i> "verifying" key, to check that
            the message is actually from <strong>you</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            your <i>private</i> signing key/fingerprint should be treated like
            a password, and stored somewhere secure (i.e a password manager).
            your <i>public</i> verifying key can be shared freely and sent around
            to all your friends who you intend to share messages with.
        </p>
        <p>
            use the button below to generate your signing keys. the underlying implementation
            uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA">Ed25519</a>.
        </p>
        <button id="gen-signing-keys">generate keys</button>
        <div id="signing-keys"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>exchange keys</h2>
        <p>
            this set of keys is used for the "end-to-end" parts of e2ee. the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>
            algorithm enables two or more people to safely send each other 
            <i>public</i> keys, and mix those public keys up with their safely hidden, 
            corresponding <i>private</i> keys, using some fancy math, to generate the <strong>same</strong>
            <i>secret</i> key on either end.
        </p>
        <p>
            long story short: when i mix your public key with my private key, and you mix my public key 
            with your private key, they produce the same secret, and the channel remains secure so long
            as we both keep our private keys a secret.
        </p>
        <p>
            just like with the signing keys, your <i>private</i> exchange key 
            should be treated like a password, and stored with a password manager.
            your <i>public</i> exchange key can/should be shared freely and sent around
            to all your friends who you intend to share messages with.
        </p>
        <p>
            use the button below to generate your exchange keys. the underlying implementation 
            uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519">X25519</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>encryption</h2>
        <p>
            to encrypt your message, we use yet another bit of fun, fancy, math. the key exchange 
            only helps us to generate a shared secret, but does not allow us to actually
            encrypt/scramble up your message; for message encryption we use what's called 
            "symmetrical encryption" to scramble up the content of your message.
        </p>
        <p>
            when you hit "encrypt" the following happens: 
            1. sign the message with your private key
            2. generate one-time 256 bit encryption key
            3. encrypt the message and signature using the one-time key
            (by encrypting your signature, we are also able to preserve
            sender-deniability, so long as the private exchange keys are not compromised)
            4. generate the shared secret with your private and their public key
            5. encrypt the one-time key using the shared secret. by encrypting an
            ephemeral/one-time key instead of using the shared secret directly, 
            we unlock the ability to send one message to multiple recipients, without having
            to re-encrypt the message/signature for each (similar
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>'s approach)
        </p>
        <p>
            plug in your private keys and their public exchange key below 
            to sign and encrypt your message. the underlying implementation
            uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305">ChaCha20Poly1305</a>
            for the symmetrical encryption algorithm.

        <h2>decryption</h2>
        <p>
            on the receiving end, we are doing basically the same things 
            we did on the sending side, just in near-reverse order, and with
            their public verifying key, instead of our private signing key.
        </p>
        <p>
            when you hit "decrypt" the following happens:
            1. generate shared secret with exchange keys
            2. decrypt the one-time 256 bit encryption key with the shared secret 
            3. decrypt the message and signature with the one-time encryption key 
            4. verify the sender's signature with their public verification key. so long
            as the signature is valid, and the sender's private signing key/fingerprint
            has not been compromised, you can be confident this message was sent from
            the person you expected.
        </p>
        <p>
            plug in your private exchange key and their public keys below
            to decrypt and verify their message.
